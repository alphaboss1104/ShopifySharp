    <releaseNotes> 
  2.1.1
  =====
  - Bugfix: `ShopifyShop.ForceSSL` wasn't serializing or deserializing properly.

  - Added an optional state parameter to OAuth installation URL built with ShopifyAuthorizationService.BuildAuthorizationUrl. #51

  2.0.2
  ======
  - Bugfix: ShopifyProductVariant.Grams field could occasionally be null, throwing a deserialization exception. Null value now defaults to 0. #48
  
  2.0.1
  ======
  - Fixed a bug where ShopifySharp would throw an `ArgumentNullException` while trying to deserialize an empty response error from Shopify. #46
  
  2.0.0
  ======
  Version 2.0.0 is a major update to ShopifySharp, it contains some breaking changes. We strongly recommend updating to 2.0.0+ **before** June 1st, 2016. Shopify will completely deprecate the method for verifying authentic requests used in `ShopifyAuthorizationService.IsAuthenticRequest` on June 1st, 2016. After that date, this method will always return false in v1 builds.
  
  Breaking changes:
  
  - `ShopifyException.Error.Errors` is now a `Dictionary{string, IEnumerable{string}}` on the ShopifyException itself. To maintain some back compat, `ShopifyException.JsonError` is the raw JSON-serialized error returned by Shopify. It's functionally identical to the old ex.Error.Errors, which was also the raw JSON string. 
  - Any enums that previously had a `.Unknown` default value are now nullable and have had those values removed. Instead of checking if `Enum == Enum.Unknown`, you should instead check if `Enum == null` or `Enum != Enum.Value`.
  - `ShopifyRecurringChargeStatus` has been merged into `ShopifyChargeStatus`.
  - All `*FilterOptions` and `*ListOptions` (used in many Service.ListAsync and Service.CountAsync calls) have been renamed to `*Filter` and moved into the `ShopifySharp.Filters` namespace.
  
  Other changes:
  
  - New feature: Forcefully uninstall your app from the shop with `ShopifyShopService.UninstallAppAsync()`.

	1.11.0

	1.10.0
	======
	- New feature: ShopifyThemeService. Create, retrieve, list, update and delete a store's themes.
	- This version marks the first use of NullableEnumConverter, which is the final solution for Shopify's undocumented, sometimes-null-sometimes-not enum values. Nullable enums are not backwards-compatible, though, so we'll have to wait until version 2.0 to apply the changes to older enums.
	
	1.9.0
	=====
	- New feature: ShopifyProductService. Create, retrieve, count, list, update and delete a store's products.
	
	1.8.0

	1.7.3
	=====
	- New property: ShopifyOrder.ContactEmail. See this announcement thread for important information about ShopifyOrder.ContactEmail and ShopifyOrder.Email: https://ecommerce.shopify.com/c/api-announcements/t/changes-to-order-email-address-294544
	
	1.7.2
	=====
	- Bugfix: ShopifyOrder.TotalWeight can be null. Changed from "int" to "int?".
      
	1.7.1
	=====
	- Bugfix: ShopifySharp.Enums.ShopifyProcessingMethod did not contain 'free' value, threw exception on deserialization. Fixed by adding 'free' value and a converter that will set any future unknown values to 'Unknown'. Next release will apply this to all enums, owing to the fact that Shopify does not document all valid enums, making it impossible to include them all without trial and error.

	1.7.0
	=====
	- New feature: ShopifyScriptTagService. Script tags let you add remote javascript tags that are loaded into the page's of a shop's storefront, letting you dynamically change the functionality of their shop without editing the store's template.

	=====
	- New feature: ShopifyChargeService. Create, retrieve, list and activate a one-time application charge.
	- Added "expired" and "cancelled" to ShopifyRecurringChargeStatus enum.
	- Bugfix: ShopifyRecurringChargeConverter did not properly convert unknown enums to ShopifyRecurringChargeStatus.Unknown. Caused exceptions when receiving charges with previously undocumented "expired" and "cancelled" statuses.
	
	1.5.0
	=====
	- Added a ShopifyRecurringChargeStatus enum to the ShopifyRecurringCharge object.
	
	1.4.0
