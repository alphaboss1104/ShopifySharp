    <releaseNotes> 
	1.10.0
	======
	- New feature: ShopifyThemeService: Create, retrieve, list, update and delete a store's themes.
	- This version marks the first use of NullableEnumConverter, which is the final solution for Shopify's undocumented, sometimes-null-sometimes-not enum values. Nullable enums are not backwards-compatible, though, so we'll have to wait until version 2.0 to apply the changes to older enums.
	
	1.9.0
	=====
	- New feature: ShopifyProductService. Create, retrieve, count, list, update and delete a store's products.
	
	1.8.0
	=====
	- New feature: ShopifyAssetService. Create, retrieve, list, update and copy a store theme's assets.

	1.7.3
	=====
	- New property: ShopifyOrder.ContactEmail. See this announcement thread for important information about ShopifyOrder.ContactEmail and ShopifyOrder.Email: https://ecommerce.shopify.com/c/api-announcements/t/changes-to-order-email-address-294544
	
	1.7.2
	=====
	- Bugfix: ShopifyOrder.TotalWeight can be null. Changed from "int" to "int?".
      
	1.7.1
	=====
	- Bugfix: ShopifySharp.Enums.ShopifyProcessingMethod did not contain 'free' value, threw exception on deserialization. Fixed by adding 'free' value and a converter that will set any future unknown values to 'Unknown'. Next release will apply this to all enums, owing to the fact that Shopify does not document all valid enums, making it impossible to include them all without trial and error.

	1.7.0
	=====
	- New feature: ShopifyScriptTagService. Script tags let you add remote javascript tags that are loaded into the page's of a shop's storefront, letting you dynamically change the functionality of their shop without editing the store's template.

	1.6.0
	=====
	- New feature: ShopifyChargeService. Create, retrieve, list and activate a one-time application charge.
	- Added "expired" and "cancelled" to ShopifyRecurringChargeStatus enum.
	- Bugfix: ShopifyRecurringChargeConverter did not properly convert unknown enums to ShopifyRecurringChargeStatus.Unknown. Caused exceptions when receiving charges with previously undocumented "expired" and "cancelled" statuses.
	
	1.5.0
	=====
	- Added a ShopifyRecurringChargeStatus enum to the ShopifyRecurringCharge object.
	
	1.4.0
	=====
	- New feature: ShopifyRecurringChargeService. Create, retrieve, list, activate and delete recurring application charges.

	1.3.6
	=====
	- Bugfix: ShopifyAuthorizationService.IsAuthenticWebhook disposed the input stream when it should not have.
	
	1.3.5
	=====
	- Bugfix: ShopifyDiscountCode is nullable, but null value was not handled.
	
	1.3.4
	=====
	- Service constructors now attempt to add a URI scheme before determining that the myShopifyUrl string is invalid.

	1.3.3
	=====
	- Implemented ShopifyWebhookService, which which enables creating, retrieving, deleting, updating, listing, and counting a shop's webhooks.

	1.3.2
